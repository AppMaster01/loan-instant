  """ Payday loans have become the face of predatory lending in America for one reason: The interest rate on the average payday loan is 391%. And that’s if you pay it back in two weeks! If you can’t repay the loans – and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says 80% of payday loans don’t get paid back in two weeks – then your interest rate soars to 521% and continues rising every time you can’t repay the debt. Compare payday loan interest rates to the average rate for alternative choices like credit cards (15%-30%); debt management programs (8%-10%); personal loans (14%-35%) and online lending (10%-35%). Nonetheless, research by the St. Louis Federal Reserve shows that more than 12 million Americans, mostly poor consumers without access to credit cards or bank loans, instead turn to payday lenders to solve short-term financial problems. In 2019, they borrowed \$29 billion and paid an astonishing \$9 billion in fees to do so, according to the Federal Reserve.""",
  """ Payday loans are a quick-fix solution for consumers in a financial crisis, but also are budget busting expenses for families and individuals. **Here is how a payday loan works:** * Consumers fill out a registration form at a Payday lending office. Identification, a recent pay stub and bank account number are the only documents needed. * Loan amounts vary from \$50 to as much as \$1,000, depending on the law in your state. If approved, you receive cash on the spot. * Full payment is due on the borrower’s next payday, which typically is two weeks. * Borrowers either post-date a personal check to coincide with their next paycheck or give the payday lender electronic access to withdraw funds from the customer’s bank account. * Payday lenders usually charge interest of \$15-\$20 for every \$100 borrowed. Calculated on an annual percentage rate basis (APR) – the same as is used for credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, etc. – that APR ranges from 391% to more than 521% for payday loans.""",
  """ Are Calculated The average payday loan in 2020 was \$375. The average interest – or “finance charge” as payday lenders refer to it – for a \$375 loan would be between \$56.25 and \$75, depending on the terms you accept. That interest/finance charge typically is somewhere between 15% and 20%, depending on the lender, but could be higher. State laws regulate the maximum interest a payday lender may charge. The amount of interest paid is calculated by multiplying the amount borrowed by the interest charge. From a mathematical standpoint, it looks like this for a 15% loan: 375 x .15 = 56.25\. If you accepted terms of \$20 per \$100 borrowed (20%), it would look like this: 375 x .20 = 75. That means you must pay \$56.25 to borrow \$375\. That is an interest rate of 391% APR. If you pay \$20 per \$100 borrowed, you pay a finance charge of \$75 and an interest rate of 521% APR.""",
  """ Are Calculated The annual percentage interest rate (APR) for payday loans is calculated by dividing the amount of interest paid by the amount borrowed; multiplying that by 365; divide that number by the length of repayment term; and multiply by 100. In mathematical terms, the APR calculations on a \$375 loan look like this: 56.25 ÷ 375 = .15 x 365 = 54.75 ÷ 14 = 3.91 x 100 = 391%. For the \$20 per \$100 borrowed (or 20%) on a \$375 loan, it looks like this: 75 ÷ 375 = .2 x 365 = 73 ÷ 14 = 5.21 x 100 = 521%. Again, those APR as astronomically higher than any other lending offered. If you used a credit card instead, even at the highest credit card rate available, you are paying less than one-tenth the amount of interest that you would on a payday loan.""",
  """ a Online loan Here’s what you can expect if you’re considering taking out a payday loan. ### What you need to provide a payday lender Generally, payday lenders will require proof that you have a: * regular income * bank account * permanent address Before giving you a payday loan, payday lenders will require you to do one of the following: * fill out a form that will allow the lender to withdraw the total loan amount, including fees, directly from your bank account when the loan is due (also called a pre-authorized debit) * provide a post-dated cheque for the total loan amount including fees Be careful when providing your banking information to a payday lender, as they will have access to funds in your account. ### Getting money from a payday lender In most cases, the payday lender will deposit money in your bank account or give you cash. However, in some cases, the payday lender may ask you to take the loan on a prepaid card. It may cost extra to activate and use the card. ### Paying back a payday loan Some payday lenders require you to repay your loan at the same location where you got your loan. In several provinces, a payday lender can’t extend or roll over your payday loan. ### Make sure you understand the agreement The payday lender will ask you to sign an agreement that shows your loan costs, including interest, fees and the due date. Read this document carefully before signing it. Ask the payday lender about anything you don’t understand. ### Online payday loans Payday lenders may operate in a physical location or online. Be careful with online payday lenders, many aren't licensed and don't follow provincial rules designed to protect borrowers. You should only use licensed online payday lenders. Beware of online payday lenders located outside Canada. If you have problems with them, it may be difficult to resolve. Also, be careful with online sites that say they offer payday loans. Some will only collect your information and give it to an actual payday lender.""",
  """ Payday loans are very expensive compared to other ways of borrowing money. This is because: * you pay high fees * the cost may be equivalent to an interest rate of 500-600% * you may have to pay a fee if your cheque or pre-authorized debit doesn't go through These high costs can make your loan harder to pay back, which can increase your financial difficulties and stress. Before taking out a payday loan, be very sure that you can pay it back on time. If not, your financial situation may get worse. Your debt can keep growing and you can end up paying a lot of money over time. **Figure 1: Comparing the cost of a payday loan with a line of credit, overdraft protection on a chequing account and a cash advance on a credit card (Based on a \$300 loan for 14 days)** |Type of loan|Cost| |--- |--- | |Line of credit|\$5.92| |Overdraft protection on a bank account|\$7.42| |Cash advance on a credit card|\$7.65| |Payday loan|\$51.00| Source:Financial Consumer Agency of Canada The costs shown in this example are for illustration purposes only and are based on the following assumptions: * a payday loan costs \$17 per \$100 that you borrow, which is the same as an annual interest rate of 442% * a line of credit includes a \$5 administration fee plus 8% annual interest on the amount you borrow * overdraft protection on a bank account includes a \$5 fee plus 21% annual interest on the amount you borrow * a cash advance on a credit card includes a \$5 fee plus 23% annual interest on the amount you borrow""",
  """ Online loan on time There can be serious consequences if you don’t repay your loan by the due date.

Contact your provincial or territorial consumer affairs office for details. ## Options to consider before getting a payday loan Will you be able to pay the loan back on time and cover your regular expenses? If not, consider the following other options that are less expensive than a payday loan. ### Cheques and hold periods When you deposit a cheque in person at your bank, you have immediate access to the first \$100 of all the money you deposited. You’ll have access to the \$100 on the next business day if you make the deposit in any other way, such as at an ATM. If the cheque is for \$100 or less, the bank must provide you with the entire amount. ### Cashing a Government of Canada cheque for free The Government of Canada has temporarily increased the cheque-cashing limit to \$2,000 for emergency benefits-related cheques to individuals. You have the right to cash your Government of Canada cheque for free at any bank. You can do this even if you're not a customer of that bank. Your cheque must be for \$1,500 or less. You need to show one piece of identification with both your photo and your signature, such as a driver’s license. ### Ask for more time to pay your bills Consider contacting the people or businesses that you owe money to. Ask for more time to pay your bills. Tell them when you get paid and offer to write a post-dated cheque for that day. ### Consider cheaper ways of borrowing money If you need the money immediately, look into less expensive alternatives. For example: * cashing in vacation days * asking for a pay advance from your employer * getting a loan from family or friends * getting a line of credit from your financial institution * getting a cash advance on a credit card * getting a personal loan from your financial institution #### Lines of credit A line of credit allows you to withdraw money whenever you want, up to a certain credit limit. You pay interest on the amount you borrow until you pay it back in full. #### Cash advances on a credit card Unlike purchases, when you take a cash advance on a credit card, you’re charged interest right away. However, the interest rates you pay are much lower than with payday loans. If you don’t have a credit card and you’ve had credit problems in the past, you may be able to get a secured credit card from a bank or other financial institution. #### Personal loans Personal loans let you borrow a fixed amount of money. You must pay back the loan, plus interest, over a fixed period of time. ### If you're stuck in a debt cycle If you’re already having trouble making ends meet because you can’t make the payments on your debts, think carefully about the long-term consequences of taking out a payday loan. Seek advice from reputable sources to explore the different financial options that are available to you. There are qualified professionals who can help you find the best solution for your financial needs. This advice is confidential, non-judgmental and often free. Some options include: * a financial advisor * an accredited credit counsellor * a licensed insolvency trustee or an insolvency lawyer""",
  """ If you're struggling for extra cash, there's a heap of options to try before plumping for a payday loan. In fact, you may not need to borrow at all. First of all, take a look at the following... ### Do you need it? Try Martin's Money Mantras If you're getting a payday loan because you need to buy something, you need to consider if that purchase is appropriate. Martin has two Money Mantras: one for if you're skint, one for those not skint. If you're getting a payday loan we will assume you're skint, or you shouldn't even be considering getting one. In which case, before you buy anything ask yourself these three questions… 1. Do I _need_it? 2. Can I _afford_ it? 3. Have I checked whether I can buy it cheaper elsewhere? **If the answer to any of these is 'no', then don't buy it.** * ### Flog your stuff for cash Shops and business do stock control, considering their assets as cash, ensuring they're utilised. We need to adopt a similar system. If you've things in your house you've not used or worn in a year, ask if it's worth keeping. If not, flog it and release the assets. Even if there are things you use occasionally, if you're considering getting a payday loan – are you sure there aren't things you can sell? Old gadgets, clothes, toys or other old items you have sitting around at home could raise the cash you need without affecting you too much. If it's old mobiles or gadgets, use Compare Mobile Buying Sites to find top prices. For other things, see our eBay Selling and Flog What You've Got tips. * ### Check this isn't just a budgeting problem Payday loans may seem to offer a quick solution, but they only postpone the problem. If you've borrowed £200 this month, and £250 (repaying the loan plus interest) is taken out of your salary on your next payday, how are you going to make sure you're not short again at the end of next month? Spending more money than you earn is a classic reason people get payday loans. Doing a proper budget will give you a clear picture of where you are overspending. Use our full online Budget Planner – get all your bank account and credit card statements, plus bills from the last six months to a year. Ensure you include everything and are totally honest. Plus look at everything you spend money on, whether car insurance, existing credit card debts, gas and electricity, or water bills and see if you're paying more than you need. Full help on this in our Money Makeover guide. * ### What could you give up to find the cash? Whether it's coffee, cigarettes, or walking instead of getting the bus – small savings can quickly add up. Try the Demotivator to see how much you can save. * ### Earn under £73,000? Check if you're entitled to any benefits Even if you don't think you're due any benefits, or if you're already claiming, it's worth checking to see if you could be eligible to claim payments. The main thing to remember is benefits are NOT just for the unemployed. Many families are entitled to Government cash but aren't aware they're eligible. In some cases, even those earning up to £73,000 may get help. See the Benefits Check-Up guide to see if you're eligible. * ### Reclaim, reclaim, reclaim – you may be owed cash! Over the last few years, a number of ways that banks, insurers and arms of government have unfairly taken cash off us have emerged. This money can be reclaimed, and can be in the £1,000s, or even £10,000s, but you need to take action to get it back. If you’ve had a payday loan in the past it may have been mis-sold, see our Reclaim Payday Loans for Free for more info. ### Check for grants and support We've listed details of help available from energy companies if you've large arrears on your gas, electricity or water bills below, though see our Housing & Energy Grants guide for full info. * **Gas & Electricity**: To apply for help with energy arrears, you'll usually need to be an account holder and complete a full income and expenditure budget sheet. You'll also need to provide proof of your income, plus give details on how your arrears have built up, eg, due to illness or redundancy, and say how the grant will help you. It can take several weeks to process your claim. Exact requirements vary – some say you need to be in receipt of certain benefits for example – but those with the greatest need are prioritised on a case-by-case basis. **Open to anyone (not just its customers)**: British Gas Energy Trust. **Open to their customers only:**EDF Energy Customer Support Fund / E.on Energy Fund / Npower Energy Fund  / Scottish Power Hardship Fund / Ovo Energy Fund. For more advice on these schemes, contact Simple Energy Advice and the Energy Saving Trust (EST) if you're in England and Wales. The Energy Saving Trust also cover Scotland and Northern Ireland. * **Water:** If you're having trouble paying your water bill and have fallen into debt, contact your water company to see what help it can offer. All companies offer some kind of help – this can be anything from providing repayment plans, discounts or even a cap on how much you pay. What's available varies from company to company. Don't worry if you're unsure which scheme is best for you. Call your provider and it will assess your circumstances and decide which one will save you the most money. For more, including a full company-by-company breakdown, see Get help if you're struggling to pay your bills. The Turn2us website also has info on all the water company schemes. * ### FREE one-on-one money or debt help If you're really struggling, know a payday loan would be damaging for you but can't think of any other options, then it's time to get some one-on-one help from a non-profit agency. If you're existing debt problems, read though our Debt Crisis Help guide for ideas or speak to Citizens Advice, National Debtline, StepChange Debt Charity or if you're struggling to deal with it emotionally too, CAP UK. They're not there to judge you, just to help – and we get incredible feedback on how they turn many people's finances around. If you're not in debt but need a bit of general money guidance to help you out of a hole, try calling the Government-funded Money Advice Service on 0300 500 5000.""",
  """## If you still absolutely NEED to borrow to plug a short-term hole in your finances, don't automatically assume you're frozen out by ‘normal' banks, and that payday loans are your only option. The methods below may be able to give you what you need instead of a payday loan. We've listed them in rough order of which to try first - though scan all of them before making a decision to see what's suitable. The aim is to replicate as closely as possible the speedy result you get from a payday lender, while costing less.  **Help if you've already got a payday loan.** In each of the methods below we list how it can be used to pay off a payday loan, so you can ditch it and get out of the cycle. We wouldn't normally suggest paying off debt with other debt, but in comparison to payday loans most of the other credit products we suggest are not so bad.  * ### 1\. A 0% credit card is the cheapest option, even for poorer credit scorers If you need to borrow money, doing it interest-free is the best way. There are plenty of 0% credit cards available and the right one for you depends on what you need the money for. Applications take between one and three weeks. Here's what you need to know. **If you need the loan to buy something.** Simply get the card, then use it to purchase whatever it is the intended payday loan was for. **If you need the loan for cash.** Don't withdraw cash on these cards - that won't be at the 0% and there'll be a fee. Instead, use one for your normal spending (don't overspend and carefully budget). The equivalent amount of unspent income will build up in your bank account which can then be used as cash. #### What to go for depends on your credit score... * ##### If you've a good credit score, go for the longest 0% Many cards offer over a year's 0%. This is worth considering if your credit score is decent as it means you have longer to repay, and can have the card ready in case you need to use the 0% again. For full help, see Top 0% Credit Cards - our Eligibility Calculator shows which ones you're likely to get. * ##### If you've a poor credit score, there are still options to try A few deals are usually available for those with a poorer credit history. Yet these offer far shorter 0% deals, then again they still last longer than a payday loan. The rub is that these cards punish you harshly for overstaying your welcome. Once the 0% periods end for spending or debt shifted from other cards, the interest you'll be charged typically jumps to around 30%. So it's doubly important you try to repay these before that happens (though that still is likely to be cheaper than payday loans).  For a full list, see Credit Cards For Bad Credit. **Important.** Regardless of the 0% spending card you go for, always follow these golden rules.  1. Pay at _least_ the monthly minimum else you'll lose the 0% deal.  2. Clear the card before the 0% ends, or you'll pay hefty interest.  3. Don't transfer over a balance from another credit card as that's usually not at the cheap rate. If you are trying to clear expensive debts, you need different cards. See Best Balance Transfers. #### How to use a 0% card to pay off an existing payday loan These cards are the holy grail of paying off a payday loan cheaply. After all, if you need to borrow money, doing it interest-free is the best way. Here's what you need to know... * ##### If you've a good credit score, use a 0% money transfer This is a relatively rare function of a few specialist cards where they pay cash into your bank account for you, for a small fee. You now have money in your account (use it to pay off the payday loan) and you've a debt on the card. Use the period at 0% to clear the debt from the card. For full help, see 0% Money Transfers. * ##### If you've a poor credit score, try a 0% spending card You can still get a 0% card to help you pay off your payday loan, it's just going to be a bit more complex, as these are 0% on spending rather than on money transfers. But, importantly, they still give you a few months with no interest to allow you a bit of respite. If you can get one of these cards, use it to pay for everything you buy where cards are accepted - but don't overspend, and carefully budget. The equivalent amount of unspent income will build up in your bank account, which you should use to pay off the payday loan. Only see the 0% period as a respite, though. On these cards, once the 0% period ends, the interest you'll be charged typically jumps to around 30%.  For a full list, see Credit Cards For Bad Credit. * ### 2\. Even a normal credit card offers interest-free spending, if you pay it off IN FULL If you spend on a credit card and CLEAR THE WHOLE CARD IN FULL next month, it's interest-free so there's nowt cheaper. So if you have this option, it's both the cheapest and easiest – as you needn't apply for anything. Two important warnings though… * If you can't clear the card in full, you'll pay interest even if you clear the amount you were planning to borrow. * This only applies to spending, not ATM cash withdrawals - you pay a fee and interest on those, so spending on a card is always cheaper than getting a cash advance. Even in these circumstances, provided you repay the debt in the same time as a payday loan – it's likely to be far cheaper. #### What if you can't clear it in full? If you don't have a card you can clear, and can't get any other form of credit that's cheaper, the next question is: do you have any credit card at all you can use? Almost every credit card, used right, is far cheaper than a payday loan. Of course, you'll need room on your credit limit. If you don't have any, speak to the card provider and see if it can increase it. If you try to spend over your credit limit you'll either be declined or will usually be charged a £12ish fee, which can be almost as costly as some payday loans. How to make best use of your card: * **If your loan is to buy something.** Simply get the card, then use it to purchase whatever it is the loan was for, then make sure you repay this amount off the card in the same time as you were due to get the payday loan (eg, the next month). * **If you need the loan for cash.** Don't withdraw cash on your credit card, as you'll pay interest even if you pay it off in full. Switch to using the credit card for your normal spending for the rest of the month (don't overspend and carefully budget). The equivalent amount of unspent income will be in your bank account, which can then be used as cash to make the purchase/pay the bill. Again make sure you then repay your card the same time as you were due to repay the payday loan - this is usually less than a month. #### How to use a credit card to pay off an existing payday loan To pay off the payday loan, you need to use the credit card for your all normal spending for the rest of the month (don't overspend and carefully budget). The equivalent amount of unspent income will build up in your bank account, which can then be used as cash to pay off the loan Then pay off the card as quickly as possible - ideally the same month so you don't pay interest. If this isn't possible, then just pay it as fast as you can. A few months at 20% interest is much less than you'll pay on an equivalent payday loan. Warning: only spend on the card, don't make ATM cash withdrawals - you pay a fee and interest on those, so spending on a card is always cheaper than getting a cash advance. _No credit limit left? _If you're maxed out, speak to the card provider and see if it can increase it. If you try to spend over your credit limit you'll either be declined or will be charged a £12 fee, which can be almost as costly as some payday loans * ### 3\. Check if you're eligible for a 0% government loan of up to £812 Though not a speedy option to get cash, some people may be able to qualify for the below. * **Budgeting loans. **If you're on income-based benefits (such as income support, pension credit, employment & support allowance, jobseeker's allowance or universal credit), you may be able to get an interest-free loan of up to £812 for essential items for your home or other necessary things that you need a lump sum for such as rent, furniture, clothing or debt repayments. Repayments depend on what you can afford, though loans last for two years at most. _ How to apply:_ Apply online at Gov.uk. Or, you can download the form from there, or pick one up from your nearest Jobcentre Plus. Sadly there isn't a bottomless pit of money, so if it's decided your circumstances aren't urgent or you're not struggling, you may not get anything. But if you think you qualify and really need the cash, it's definitely worth a shot. You'll get a decision within 20 working days if you apply online - other ways take longer - then the money comes within a further 21 working days. * **Hardship payments and advances if you're on universal credit.** If you're yet to receive your first universal credit payment (or your usual payment has been stopped or reduced) and you don't have enough money to live on, you can apply for an advance payment, which means you'll receive the initial amount early. It will then be automatically repaid back by the reduction of future universal credit payments. You can apply online or via a Jobcentre Plus. Full information at Gov.uk. * **Emergency? Try local council support schemes: **Each local authority is responsible for providing help to residents struggling with an emergency. Although each council's criteria are different, you'll need to be on income-based benefits to qualify, and priority's usually given to those on the lowest incomes. This could include you or your family's health being at risk (eg, if your boiler's packed up mid-winter), not being able to afford to buy food, needing help to stay in your own home and coming out of care, hospital or prison. Sadly, this is a postcode lottery. Each council can choose whether to offer financial help or not or who is eligible. For example, some may give furniture, clothing, white goods or food grants, some may give vouchers, while others may give cash. Contact your local council to find out its procedure. For more things to try, look at our Low Income Grants guide. #### How to use this to pay off an existing payday loan This may not be a solution for everyone, as most payday lenders won't lend to those on income-based benefits, and you need to be in receipt of these to qualify for a Government budgeting loan. But it may work if your circumstances have changed since you took out the payday loan.  If you've been on income-based benefits (such as universal credit or one of the legacy benefits income support, pension credit, employment & support allowance or jobseeker's allowance) for at least six months, you may be able to get an interest-free loan of £100-£812\. Technically, these loans are for essential items for your home or other necessary things that you need a lump sum for such as rent, furniture, clothing or debt repayments. You'll need to use the loan for the purpose it was intended for ie, essential items for your home. Meanwhile, use the other income you have that you're now not using for living expenses to pay off the payday loan. Repayments depend on what you can afford, though loans last for two years at most. * ### 4\. Turn to family for help Although borrowing from family (or a close friend) can be tricky, if you're in a bad way it may be worth asking for help, even if it's just going round for dinner to save on buying food. Plus, often talking about your money problems can be a huge relief (see the Debt-Free Wannabe board on the MSE forums). If someone will help you out, do it formally. Write down the amount and when you'll repay them. Hopefully they won't charge interest (or if they do, see if they'll accept a pint as thanks, or a token sum at the end of the loan). If it is a close family member (such as a parent) and they don't have the cash, but they do have a better credit score than you, then as long as they're willing, they could try some of the alternatives above to get the cash to lend to you. But they must be aware the debt is then legally theirs, not yours. * ### 5\. See if your local credit union will offer you a loan Credit unions and Community Development Finance Institutions are independently-run local co-operative organisations which aim to assist people who may not have access to financial products and services elsewhere. For many, they're a welcome and cheaper alternative to payday loans, often doing loans that are similar. Credit union loan rates are capped, and the maximum you can be charged on a loan is 42.6% APR (equivalent to 3% per month). Most loans are cheaper than this, and the highest rate is generally only used for very short term loans.  See the best buys for credit unions offering payday-style loans. #### How to use this to pay off an existing payday loan If you can find a local credit union doing payday-style loans, borrow cash from them to pay off your 1,000%+ APR payday loan, then you'll have between one and six months to pay the credit union back.  * ### 6\. Can you extend your overdraft? It's usually cheaper than a payday loan Usually we suggest people avoid using their overdraft facility if they'll incur interest. Yet even with high interest costs of around 40%, this is usually cheaper than a payday loan, especially if you can minimise the length of time you remain overdrawn, Our Best Bank Accounts guide tells you the best accounts if you're overdrawn - and some even have 0% overdrafts, which'll allow you time to sort out your finances. If you're already at your limit with overdrafts (and can't extend), have maxed out your credit card, and have a payday loan that you're struggling to pay off, then consider getting help with your debts. See the full Debt Help guide. #### How to use this to pay off an existing payday loan Use your overdraft to pay off all (or as much as possible) of your expensive payday loan, by making a card payment or bank transfer. You'll then be overdrawn by that amount and will owe your bank instead.  ### Or, get a credit union loan Credit unions are not-for-profit organisations, set up to help members save or borrow – often offering short-term lending at more affordable rates than 'normal' payday lenders. Each has a 'common bond', which is the criteria you'd need to meet before you can join. This is essentially who the credit union is set up to help, for example residents of a certain town, or employees of a particular industry. We've listed credit unions below where many people would qualify, though the Find Your Credit Union site searches over 380 credit unions and shows you which you may be able to join, based on your home or work postcode, employer and groups or associations you may be part of.

  """## If the above options don't work for you or aren't right, you could consider a short-term payday loan. Please read each and every warning in here and consider your options very carefully before going ahead.  ### 1\. Borrow as little as possible and budget to pay it off as soon as you can Many payday lenders give you the option to pay your loan back over three months rather than one. This can help with budgeting, in that you don't have to pay the loan back in one great whack once your next paycheck's arrived. But, remember, the longer you borrow for, the more interest you'll have to pay. Most lenders will let you pay the loan off early. This means you could repay a three-month loan after just a few days or weeks, without paying any penalties - though double check before taking out loan if the lender charges any early repayment fees. The quicker you repay, the less interest you will rack up, so the overall cost will be much cheaper. Even if you stick to the agreed repayment term, always, always have a plan for how you'll pay back the money. See How to Budge for help to manage your finances. * ### 2\. If you know you can't repay on time, avoid at all costs. If you later can't pay, tell your lender immediately If you do go for a payday loan, the crucial point is that you know how you are going to pay it back. If not, then you can't afford the loan. (If you're given one, you've been mis-sold. See our tool and guide in Reclaim Payday Loans for Free.) No matter how desperate you are, the end result will leave you much worse off. If you feel desperate and that it's your only option, even though you aren't sure you'll repay it, you'd be far better getting one-on-one debt counselling help from a non-profit debt counselling agency. ##### If you're later unable to pay, contact the lender immediately. If you take out a loan with a plan to pay it back and something later goes wrong so you can't, contact the lender as soon as you can and ask it for help.  Always, always tell your lender as soon as you know you're not going to be able to repay. It does work. Be firm, make a fair offer and be willing to answer questions about your income and expenditure honestly. It should then offer you a fair and affordable way to repay, such as a structured repayment plan and the freezing of interest and charges,  * ### 3\. Don't take out a payday loan to repay another. If you're regularly getting payday loans there's a problem Payday loans should never be used as a way to fill the gap between your incomings and outgoings each and every month. If that's happening to you, there's a fundamental problem that a payday loan will only make worse not better. An irresponsible lender will take advantage of this. If this is happening, you've been mis-sold. Go to our free tool and guide Reclaim Payday Loans for Free. To stop being sucked in a downward spiral, the most important thing to do is to sort out a budget to try to balance your costs and income. It's easy to be tempted to get one payday loan for a small amount, then another the next month, and before you know it, you're in a debt spiral. See this story from forumite _leopardxgirl_ as a stark warning. _About 8 months ago I borrowed around £90 to pay for a train ticket to see my now ex-boyfriend. What a slippery slope that was. I'm now approx £3,500 into payday loans across four payday lenders. I seem to have got myself into a horrible situation where I can only barely afford the interest repayments on these darn things every month._ * ### 4\. Payday loans can hit your ability to get a mortgage - even if paid on time Apply for any credit, and lenders 'score' you to predict your likely behaviour. They use data from credit reference agencies as part of this (see the Credit Scores guide). But a payday loan on your credit report can have a striking effect. All credit reference agencies differentiate payday loans on your credit report. They’re in a different section, so underwriters (who make lending decisions) can tell how much and how often you've used payday loans. ##### Can a payday loan stop me getting a mortgage? A few mortgage lenders have publicly said applicants who have used payday loans won't be accepted for a mortgage with them - even if they were fully repaid on time. Yet even those who haven’t spoken up are likely to behave in a similar way. One of the UK’s top technical experts on mortgages, Ray Boulger from broker John Charcol, says: _Most lenders will run a mile if an applicant has had even one payday loan in the last year._ This is because the presence of a payday loan on the credit record of a mortgage applicant implies there's some underlying problem with their budgeting and money management. That throws serious doubt on their ability to consistently meet a monthly mortgage payment. * ##### I've seen adverts saying a payday loan can improve my credit rating. Is that true? Some payday loan firms claim getting it has a positive effect. Of course, if you get a payday loan, paying it in full and on time is important. It'll certainly give you a relatively better score than not doing so. Similarly, missing a payment or late payments will harm your credit score. Yet payday lenders' claims that getting one will help your credit score are likely to be overblown. It can boost indicative scores from the credit rating agencies – but this isn't the same as making lenders more likely to give you conventional credit cards or loans. Each lender scores you differently, based on its own wishlist of what makes a profitable customer. Some will see a marginal improvement from payday loans – but equally, others may follow the path of mortgage lenders and see it as a big no-no. If you need to rebuild a bad credit history there are other, better ways to do that, with specific Credit Cards for Bad Credit. * ### 5\. They are an expensive form of borrowing, though there is a cap on charges and interest There are three elements to this cap: * Lenders can only charge 80p interest per £100 per day (0.8%). So, if you borrowed £100 for 30 days, you shouldn't pay more than £24 in interest. * Lenders can't charge more than £15 as a fee if you pay late. * You'll never pay back more than double what you borrowed. So, if you borrow £100, you will never pay back more than £200 when all interest, late fees and charges are taken into account. This is more relevant than the APR you'll see displayed. This stands for the Annual Percentage Rate, and essentially tells you the cost of borrowing if you were to have it over a year.  As you're borrowing over a short period, even a small fee can become an astronomical APR. Payday loans are expensive but if you express the typical charges payday lenders make as APRs most work out as over 1,000%. This is a useful warning against what can be dangerous products, but these APRs are mostly meaningless. * ##### What exactly is APR? APR stands for the Annual Percentage Rate, and it's the official rate used for borrowing. When it's calculated it has to include: * The cost of the borrowing, so the amount of interest charged _plus_ * Any associated fees that are automatically included, such as an application or annual fee An APR is therefore meant to give you the overall equivalent cost of a debt, which you can then use to compare against other credit and loan products. It must be displayed by a lender before any agreement is signed.  * ##### Why do they have to put these APRs if they're meaningless? Well, it's a legal requirement that if you're offering loans to people, then you have to have your APR marked in large letters on all adverts, and on your website. But, many have pointed out the pointlessness of this with a payday loan. APR stands for 'annual percentage rate'. Put simply, it's the rate you pay on what you've borrowed over a year, including all interest and charges. But, here's where it falls down. Payday loans are usually taken out for a matter of weeks, rather than for years. So, the amount you will have to pay back is really more relevant than the APR for these loans. See Martin's blog on how an APR can confuse as much as it can clarify what's really going on.   * ### 6\. Every legitimate lender will do a credit check and check you can repay. Avoid any that claim it won't Some, especially smaller, payday lenders don't share your payment data with credit reference agencies. These are generally the ones that advertise "payday loans with no credit checks". This can seem like a good thing, as it won't "ruin" your credit rating by putting the payday loan on your file (though a future lender could ask you). But it also means the payday lender's not lending responsibly as it's not checking you can afford to repay. It also means other lenders won't be able to see the loan, so as a consequence, their lending may not be responsible either. Irresponsible lending is mis-selling. See our free tool and guide Reclaim Payday Loans for Free. The 'responsible' payday lenders - the ones which credit check each applicant – say they turn down between 60% and 90% of first-time applicants because their credit records show they're already too indebted to have a good chance of paying their loans back. Think carefully if you're going to a payday lender because it advertises 'no credit checks'. Can you really afford to repay it? * ### The lender will have authorised access to take money from your bank account A common tactic of payday lenders is to ask you to pay using something called a continuous payment authority (CPA, also known as a recurring payment). This is where you tell it the 16-digit number on the front of your card. This gives the lender the right to automatically take a payment, though it's limited to two attempts to collect payment, and should only be taken on the day it is due. It can only claim the full payment required, rather than part-payments, but it can be dangerous, especially if you have other, more important bills to pay. * ##### How can I cancel a Continuous Payment Authority? You have a right to cancel CPAs simply by asking the bank which runs your account. See the Recurring Payments guide for full help. We're not suggesting to cancel this and not repay, but the lack of control these types of payments give you is scary - it can be far better to call them and pay up as and when you owe the money. * ### 8.Always check a lender is registered with the FCA first. Payday lenders can be bad – loan sharks are MUCH worse Payday loan companies, though they may lay traps for you, are authorised by the FCA (check at the FCA Register). So if things go wrong, you have some limited room for recourse. But loan sharks are a completely different beast. They're unlicensed, they break the law, often go knocking door-to-door and at worst they use horrific methods - including violence and threats of violence against the borrower, their family or children - to get their money repaid. * ##### How do I report an illegal loan shark? If you know of loan sharks near you, report them on 0300 555 2222 – you can also text LOAN SHARK and lender's details to 60003, visit StopLoanSharks or download its app (England only). If you're elsewhere in the UK, contact details to report loan sharks are on the Government's Report a Loan Shark page. When borrowing, always check whether the lender is authorised by the FCA. ### How to find and compare short-term loans If you've jumped straight here - please read the cheaper alternatives first. Payday loans are expensive and should be considered as a last resort. If you still feel a payday loan is right for you, this information will help you find and compare short-term loans. First, here are our key need-to-knows before comparing lenders. * **Find out the real price to you.** Charges vary from company to company. On average, it's around £24 per month per £100 borrowed. Yet there's no one cheapest here, as it depends on the exact amount and length of borrowing. So always ensure you know: _A. What you repay if you repay on time_ – compare based on that. _B. Just in case - what would happen if you couldn't repay?_ If this is a realistic possibility (obviously we'd prefer you didn't get a loan at all in these circumstances), factor this into your decision very carefully. * **Watch out for payday loan brokers.** Payday loan brokers will look like payday lenders, but they won't be able to lend to you. Instead, they'll charge you a fee for referring your application to a payday lender. If you are going for a payday loan (and make sure you've checked none of the alternatives above are suitable first), don't fall for this scam.  * **Ensure the company is legit.** Adverts for payday loans are everywhere - especially online, so it's tricky to know where to go. Before applying, check the company's registered with the FCA. It's important to do this as some payday lenders operate illegally. * **Make sure you know the application criteria.** This varies from lender to lender, but you'll need to be over 18 years old, have a full bank account with debit card, a regular income and with most payday lenders you will have to pass a credit check (some say they reject as many as two-thirds of first time applicants). You'll also need some proof of your identity and your income. * **Watch out for marketing opt-ins.** Some lenders have marketing opt-outs/ins on their application forms. If you say you're happy to hear from them and 'selected' third parties, then it means they're able to sell your data to whoever they like. Always make sure you say no to marketing. #### If you've read all the warnings above and are still sure a payday loan is right, these short-term loan comparison sites at least compare multiple loans... All the lenders and Choose Wisely compare a range of short-term lenders. Though be warned, these sites still contain VERY expensive loans, so use them at your own risk. Neither will compare every loan provider, though both do have an eligibility checker which will show you which lenders are likely to accept you. This uses a soft search check, so won't impact your credit score. However if you then go on to apply, this will leave a search that other lenders can see. You can compare loans with a minimum term of three months, though look for lenders that allow you to pay off the loan early without penalty – remember the quicker you can clear the loan, the less interest you'll pay.   ## Want to complain about your loan provider? If your loan provider has charged you the wrong amount, taken the wrong amount in payment, or its service has been atrocious, then you don't have to suffer in silence. It's always worth trying to call your lender first to see if it can help, but if it can't (or won't), or it doesn't get back to you...""",
  """ A payday loan is a high-cost short-term loan of up to \$2,000 that is usually paid to the applicant within 24 hours. These loans are typically reserved for emergency situations such as medical treatment, home repairs and car repairs. The term ‘payday loan’ implies that the borrower intends pay back the lender through future income. Payday loans tend to come with high fees, which is why they should only be used for emergency purposes. ### What is a bad credit payday loan? Bad credit payday loans enable Australians with bad credit to borrow money from payday lenders. Payday lenders have different criteria than major banks when giving loans, making them more lenient towards those who have bad credit. Legit payday loans for bad credit involve a lender looking at the borrower’s employment situation in addition to any other income such as Centrelink payments. ### Who offers payday loans? Payday loans are offered by multiple financial institutions willing to take on the risk usually associated with high-cost short-term loans. Payday lenders tend to be small, non-bank institutions rather than well-known banks. ### How do you take out a payday loan? Many payday lenders offer loans through an online or phone application process. In addition to providing personal details and confirming identification, borrowers will also need to provide banking details and evidence of income. After a quick credit check by the lender, most loans are assessed and - if approved - delivered within 24 hours. Payday loans for bad credit instant approval are possible, but a severe history of default from the borrower could end in the application being rejected by the lender. Case study Lucy needs a car to get to her job, but it stopped working and required \$1,400 in repairs that she couldn’t afford. Lucy has bad credit and just four months of employment, so she was only eligible for a payday loan after exhausting all other lending options. Within 24 hours, Lucy received her payday loan with a six-month term and got her car fixed. Lucy paid off her debt in four months and avoided any extra monthly fees and arrears fees. She also made sure to pay her monthly balance on time to avoid late payment fees. Lucy ended up paying the following over the course of her payday loan: \$1,400 loan amount + \$280 establishment fee (20 per cent on original loan amount) + \$224 monthly fees (4 per cent on original loan amount) = \$1,904\. In the end, Lucy paid and extra \$504 (36 per cent) for her emergency car repairs. ### How long does it take to get a payday loan? Most payday loans will be deposited into the applicant’s account within 24 hours. Given the nature of these loans (e.g. emergencies), some payday lenders can also deliver cash to the lender’s bank account within minutes. The time it takes to receive a loan can be affected by the applicant’s credit history. Borrowers seeking an urgent payday loan with bad credit could see a longer application process. ### What are the pros and cons of payday loans? The pros of payday loans are: * Get cash quickly for emergencies * Convenient application process * Loans are available for those with bad credit * Unsecured loans available (no collateral needed) The cons of payday loans are: * High application and account-keeping fees * One of the most risky methods of borrowing money * Potential of worsening borrower’s financial situation * High late payment and default fees Because it can be quite expensive to pay off a payday loan, borrowers are encouraged to exhaust all other options first. Payday loans should only be used in emergency situations when no other options are available. ### Can you get a payday loan if you're on Centrelink? Yes, Centrelink recipients are able to receive payday loans under certain conditions. The loan must not exceed 20 per cent of the applicant’s income if the borrower receives at least half of their income from Centrelink. Borrowers can apply for payday loans with bad credit on Centrelink as long as they meet the above criteria. ### Can self-employed people get payday loans? Yes, self-employed people are able to receive payday loans as these lenders tend to be more flexible than major banks. However, applicants who are self-employed will need to provide a history of income. Borrowers will usually need to provide the payday lender with bank statements from the last 90 days. Payday loans for self-employed people with bad credit can be obtained by applicants who can prove a solid history of income. ### What are the best online payday loans for bad credit? The best payday loans for people with bad credit in Australia are those that meet the borrowers needs but give reasonable expectations to pay off the debt. Here are some things applicants should look for: * **Maximum loan amount** – this is the highest amount of cash that can be given to the borrower. Applicants should ensure the funds they receive will adequately cover their emergency financial needs. * **Loan term** – this is the amount of time the borrower will have to pay off their debt. A longer loan term should mean lower monthly bills, but this also means more monthly fees and more money out of pocket for the duration of the loan. * **Turnaround time** – the amount of time it should take for the applicant to receive their cash from the lender. * **Establishment fee** – this is a one-time fee applied to the original amount loaned. This is a percentage of the loan and cannot exceed 20 per cent. * **Monthly fee**–- this is a monthly fee represented as a percentage of the original amount loaned. The monthly fee cannot exceed 4 per cent. * **Late payment fee **– amount owed if the monthly bill is not paid on time. * **Arrears fee** – amount owed monthly or weekly if the debt is not paid off within the loan term period. * **Requirements** – these are the criteria the applicant needs to meet in order to be a successful applicant. Such requirements include being at least 18 and being employed. * **Centrelink availability** – this describes which lenders give loans to applicants who are on Centrelink. Borrowers with at least half their income from Centrelink cannot receive a loan that exceeds 20 per cent of their income. Case study Gary plays guitar as a hobby and wanted to buy a new guitar for \$1,700 but couldn’t afford it. Gary has full-time employment and fairly good credit. He wanted the guitar as soon as possible, so he applied for a payday loan without exploring other lending options. Within an hour he received the loan with a one-year term for the new guitar. Gary unexpectedly lost his job and was late on four of his payments. Additionally, he was three weeks late paying off the debt within the loan term and receive arrears fees. In the end, Gary paid the following for his new guitar: \$1,700 loan amount + \$340 establishment fee (20 per cent on original loan) + \$816 (4 per cent on original loan amount) + \$140 late payment fees (\$35 per late payment) + \$90 arrears fees (\$30 per week) = \$3,086\. Gary ended up paying an extra \$1,386 (about 82 per cent) on the price of the guitar. Had he explored other options, Gary could have found a more favourable loan for this non-emergency expense. ### What are some alternatives to payday loans? Given the notoriously high fees that come with most payday loans, it is recommended that borrowers exhaust all other options first. Here are some available alternatives: * **Centrelink advance** – some borrowers will find they can get an advance on their Centrelink payment with no interest fees. * **No-interest loan** – borrowers with low income might be eligible for a no-interest loan. These loans are not for cash, but can help with things such as household goods and health items that range from \$300 to \$1,200. * **Low-interest-rate credit card** – most credit limits available should cover the applicant’s financial needs. Interest will be owed on the credit debt, but this should still be more affordable than the high fees associated with a payday loan. * **Personal loan** – the interest rates on personal loans are typically more favourable than the fees of a payday loan. * **Request an extension** – a potential borrower who is in an emergency financial situation could potentially get an extension on their bills. Payday loans are expensive and should only be sought in the event of an emergency after all other lending options have been exhausted. Those who are under economic stress are advised to seek financial counselling or contact the National Debt Helpline for assistance.""",

[To illustrate, if X takes a loan of \$1,000, and X has repaid \$400, only the remaining \$600 can be taken into account for the computation of interest.] **Q3 | Can I have a representative example of the total cost of the loan, including all applicable fees?** To illustrate, if X takes a loan of \$1,000 with a repayment period of 6 months Principal Amount= \$1,000 Annual Interest= 47% Repayment Period= 6 months Monthly Payment= (1000 * 0.47/12 ) / [ 1 – ( 1 + 0.47/12) ^ - 6 ] = \$190.24 Total Cost= 1000 * 10% + ( 190.24 * 6 – 1000) = \$241.44 *The cost is made up of a 10% administration fee and 4% monthly interest fee. Total Repayable= \$190.24 * 6 = \$1,141.44""",
  """ The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau introduced a series of regulation changes in 2017 that were supposed to protect borrowers by forcing the payday lenders to determine if the borrower could afford to take on a loan with a 391% interest rate. However, the Trump administration rejected the argument that consumers needed protection. The CFPB has since decided it will remove the regulation altogether, though they promised to take public comment on it through June of 2020. Here are the five changes to protect consumers that originally were approved, but now appear to be dead in the water. ### Full Payment Test Payday lenders would have to verify the borrower’s income to determine whether he/she could cover basic financial obligations (housing, food, clothing, transportation) and have enough income to repay the loan. Lenders also would have to look at the borrower’s credit report to check for other loan obligations. ### Principal Payoff Option This rule would limit the consumer to borrowing nor more than \$500 if they couldn’t pass the “Full Payment Test.” **Other restrictions include:** * Not allowing the lender to take the borrower’s car title as collateral for a loan. * Not allowing the lender to make a loan to a consumer who already has a short-term loan. * Restricting loan extensions to borrower who paid at least one-third of the principal owed on each extension. * Requiring lenders to disclose the Principal Payoff Option to all borrowers. ### Cooling Off Period When borrowers can’t repay the original loan after two weeks, they often “Roll Over” the loan and are charged fees and interest again for an increased amount. This proposal said that there must be a 30-day “cooling off period” for borrowers who have taken out a loan and rolled it over twice, before they can request another loan. ### Mandatory Reporting This regulation would have required lenders to report their loans to the three major credit reporting bureaus and update them as payments are made or not made. ### Alternate Options Lenders would have been required to offer longer-term loans that would mean considerably less risk for borrowers. That would include an option to limit interest rates to 28% (APR). Another option would be to have fixed payments over a two-year period with an interest rate no higher than 36%. Though the fate of the five changes hasn’t officially been decided, the CFPB appears to be headed in the direction of abandoning them, at least the part where payday lenders would have to do research to determine if the borrower could afford the loan. ## How Do Payday Loans Work? Payday loans are a quick-fix solution for consumers in a financial crisis, but also are budget busting expenses for families and individuals. **Here is how a payday loan works:** * Consumers fill out a registration form at a Payday lending office. Identification, a recent pay stub and bank account number are the only documents needed. * Loan amounts vary from \$50 to as much as \$1,000, depending on the law in your state. If approved, you receive cash on the spot. * Full payment is due on the borrower’s next payday, which typically is two weeks. * Borrowers either post-date a personal check to coincide with their next paycheck or give the payday lender electronic access to withdraw funds from the customer’s bank account. * Payday lenders usually charge interest of \$15-\$20 for every \$100 borrowed. Calculated on an annual percentage rate basis (APR) – the same as is used for credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, etc. – that APR ranges from 391% to more than 521% for payday loans.""",
  """ the payday lender about the total cost of borrowing when you first apply for the loan. Be sure to find out: * all the fees, charges and interest * the date the loan is due * if there is a maximum cost you can be charged for a payday loan Ask about fees applied if you’re unable to pay back your loan on time. Understand that: * a fee is often charged if your cheque or pre-authorized debit is returned due to non-sufficient funds * these fees can range from \$20 to \$50 * many provinces have rules about maximum fees for non-sufficient funds * the amount can be much higher in provinces and territories where the fee is unregulated Ask if there is a “cooling off” period. This is a period, often a day or two, during which you can cancel the loan with no explanation and without paying any fees. The laws in many provinces protect this right. Make sure to get the “cooling off” period information in writing from the payday lender. Ask for a copy of the loan agreement. Make sure you: * read this document carefully before signing it * understand the total cost of the loan * keep a copy for your records so that you have something to refer to if there’s any problem * don’t sign for the loan if the lender won’t give you a copy of the agreement ## Payday lending rules where you live The rules and regulations for payday loans may change depending on where you live. ### License Most provinces require a payday lender to have a license. ### Fees and penalties Many provinces regulate payday lending fees and penalties. |Province|Maximum cost of borrowing for a \$100 payday loan|Cooling off period to cancel the payday loan|Maximum penalty for a returned cheque or pre-authorized debit| |--- |--- |--- |--- | |Alberta|\$15|2 business days|\$25| |British Columbia|\$15|2 business days|\$20| |Manitoba|\$17|48 hours, excluding Sundays and holidays|\$20| |New Brunswick|\$15|48 hours, excluding Sundays and holidays|\$20| |Newfoundland and Labrador|\$21|2 business days|\$20| |Nova Scotia|\$19|Next business day (2 days for online payday loans)|\$40 (default penalty)| |Ontario|\\\$15|2 business days|n/a| |Prince Edward Island|\\\$25|2 business days|n/a| |Saskatchewan|\\\$17|Next business day|\$25| ### Restrictions In the following provinces, a payday lender can’t extend or roll over your payday loan: * Alberta * British Columbia * New Brunswick * Nova Scotia * Ontario * Saskatchewan A payday lender can’t ask you to sign a form that transfers your wages directly to them in the following provinces: * Alberta * British Columbia * Manitoba * New Brunswick * Nova Scotia * Ontario * Saskatchewan Provincial laws define what a payday lender can do when trying to collect a loan.
